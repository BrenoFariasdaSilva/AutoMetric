Welcome to the **AutoMetric** program! This tool automates the extraction of metadata from GitHub and GitLab repositories that measures Open-Source Software (OSS)quality metrics. It provides insights such as the number of contributors (NC), mean time to update (MTTU), mean time to commit (MTTC), branch protection status (BP), and inactive periods (IP) for repositories.
